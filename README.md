This repository contains two files:

* `how.txt` explains how to build the proper software to get started.
* `start.sh` gives you examples of how to start the software once you've build it.

This part of the project will allow you to start the Base Station Controller (BSC).
You will need a BTS and Transceiver to talk to your UmTRX, please see [the companion project](https://github.com/shimaore/umtrx-osmo-bts) for that.
